The folder contains all the scripts used to extract the ESA CCI LC masks for disturbed and undisturbed areas, preprocess the LC masks, and generate various visualizations, including charts, transition matrices, bubble plots, and Sankey diagrams. These scripts play a crucial role in analyzing and visualizing land cover changes effectively.
